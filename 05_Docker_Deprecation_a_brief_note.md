# Docker Deprecation: a brief note

This short note is meant to correct a common misunderstanding: when people say “Docker is deprecated,” many students assume Docker is “gone” or no longer relevant. What the instructor clarifies is more precise: **Kubernetes deprecated Docker as a *supported container runtime*** (because it no longer needs Docker Engine to run containers), but **Docker itself is not dead** and remains widely used.

Historically, Docker was the original (and initially the only) runtime Kubernetes supported. Later, Kubernetes introduced the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** so that Kubernetes could work with multiple runtimes, not just Docker. The instructor reminds you that “Docker” is actually a bundle of tools: the Docker CLI, APIs, image build tools, features for volumes, authentication and security, and underneath it the runtime stack involving **runc** plus the daemon that manages the runtime, which is **containerd**. The key point is that **containerd is the part that can work directly with Kubernetes** in the same way other CRI-supported runtimes do—and containerd can also be installed and used independently of the full Docker package.

Once Kubernetes could rely on CRI-compatible runtimes (like containerd), it didn’t need Docker’s extra tooling (Docker CLI, Docker API, build tooling, etc.) for orchestration. Those operational responsibilities—deployment, scaling, networking connectivity, desired state management—are handled by Kubernetes itself. Because maintaining Docker-specific support (via shim layers, historically) became unnecessary, Kubernetes could **deprecate Docker runtime support**. But that deprecation is about Kubernetes’ runtime integration, not about the usefulness of Docker in general.

So, Docker is still extremely common in day-to-day development and build workflows: developers use it to build images, run containers locally, and standardize environments. In this course, the instructor will continue using Docker as the *example tool* when teaching container basics, because it’s familiar and practical. And if you don’t have Docker installed (or you’re on containerd-only setups), you can still follow along by using equivalent commands—most of the time, simply replacing `docker` with **`nerdctl`** (“node control” in your transcript) will work for the same examples.
