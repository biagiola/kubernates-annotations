# Kubernates setup

This lecture is about the different ways you can **set up a Kubernetes cluster and access it**, depending on your goals, time, and available resources. The instructor emphasizes there isn’t a single “right” way—there are several valid approaches—and you should pick the option that fits your learning needs instead of feeling like you must follow every demo.

They group the options into three broad categories. First, you can set up Kubernetes **locally** on your own laptop or on local virtual machines. Second, you can use a **managed Kubernetes service** from a cloud provider, where the provider provisions and operates the cluster for you. Third, if you want instant access without setting anything up, you can use **public playgrounds** that provide a ready-to-use cluster in the browser.

For local setups, the lecture mentions three popular tools: **Docker Desktop**, **minikube**, and **kubeadm**. Docker Desktop is presented as the easiest on-ramp because it has Kubernetes support built in, so you can enable it and quickly get a cluster. Minikube is another beginner-friendly option that creates an “all-in-one” Kubernetes environment—typically a single-node cluster—on your machine. Kubeadm is introduced as a tool for configuring Kubernetes in a **multi-node** setup (more like real-world clusters), and the instructor notes they’ll go deeper into kubeadm later.

For cloud setups, the instructor mentions hosted/managed Kubernetes offerings on major providers like **GCP, AWS, and Azure**, describing them as “one-click” experiences: you press a button, a full cluster is provisioned, you get access, and you can start using Kubernetes without spending time installing the control plane and nodes yourself.

If you don’t want to invest time/resources into any setup—or you just want to quickly run commands and experiment—then **playgrounds** are described as the best option. The instructor specifically mentions a browser-based playground offered by the course provider (referred to as “KodeKloud” in many Kubernetes courses) that gives instant cluster access. A key feature highlighted is that the playground offers **multiple historical Kubernetes versions** (the instructor says up to four), which is useful if you want to compare behavior and features across different Kubernetes versions without building separate clusters yourself.

The lecture then briefly shows what Docker Desktop looks like and why it’s convenient. Docker Desktop is described as a free solution you install from Docker’s website, with installers for multiple platforms: Mac (including both Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows (including AMD and ARM variants), and Linux. Once installed, Docker Desktop provides a UI where you can view running containers and related information. The “best part,” in the instructor’s framing, is that Kubernetes is built in: you go into **Settings → Kubernetes** and enable it, and Docker Desktop sets up a Kubernetes cluster in the background that you can start using immediately.

After that, the lecture transitions into **minikube** and explains *why* it exists. Earlier lectures introduced the Kubernetes architecture: the control plane components (API server, etcd, controllers, scheduler) and the worker-side pieces (kubelet and a container runtime). Installing and wiring all these components manually across multiple machines can be slow and complex, especially for learning. Minikube solves this by bundling the necessary Kubernetes components into a **single preconfigured image**, effectively giving you a ready-to-run **single-node Kubernetes cluster** you can start “in minutes.” The instructor describes this bundle as being packaged as an **ISO image** available online. You typically don’t manually download it; instead, minikube provides an executable CLI that automatically downloads the ISO and deploys it on a virtualization platform.

Because minikube deploys into a virtualized environment, you need a **hypervisor** on your machine. The lecture gives examples: on Windows you might use VirtualBox or Hyper-V; on Linux you might use VirtualBox or KVM; and they also mention VMware Fusion as a virtualization option. Finally, to actually interact with the cluster, you also need the Kubernetes CLI tool **kubectl** installed locally.

So, for minikube specifically, the instructor boils the requirements down to three things: (1) a **hypervisor**, (2) **kubectl**, and (3) the **minikube executable**. The lecture ends right before a demo where they plan to show it working.
